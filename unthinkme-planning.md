# unThinkMe Production Outlines

---

## Science Guys: Cleansing the Palette with PBS SPACETIME

#### Adam & James {number}

### PLANNING & TOPIC

Another science guy show, demonstrating how bad-4ss the remarkably handsome Matt O'Dowd is. This is how you talk about Simultation Hypothesis, science guys! 

### PRODUCTION

- Develop an outline like this before the show starts, and start with cues and notes.
- Make a login for James, and create "unlinked" url `/unthinkme_planning``, 
- add md to database
- Is it smart to serve markdown from firestore?
- create hosted function `setMdToPlanningDb` (replace data), collection `planning`. 
- Add info from "theonesheet" here.
- Ask GPT if this deployment method is recommended, or something simpler.

### SHOW

- Thinking if I brand the podcast more, I won't need to edit so much - "it's just the pc".
- Remember that you are not perfectionist when the switch is up.
- Establish the context more at the top of the show, particularly how it relates to past videos and integral (might need notes). 
- I need to work on responding to James and asking questions and following his line. 

### ASSETS

- Need Categories of episode brands (by popularity probably):

    1 Documentary Style  
    2 Lectures  
    3 Adam & James  
    4 Group/Guest   
    5 Practices  
    6 One-Offs

- unThinkme stock assets for thumbnails, including titles, brand logos (per category and for show), integral model, 

- Consistent thubnails are probably good for brand, so lock a few parameters in.
