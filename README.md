## DOCKET SHOWS

### Learn To Sing: You Already Are

The root fundamental fact is that you improve by doing and trying to do better confidently and with self-awareness. We cover the basic ideas of openness to singing now, making it beautiful now, hard and strong and not overdoing it, having the attitude that I can't possibly do anything wrong, I'll just do it as well as I can, and creating an environment of singing, and a self-image of being a singer.

### Technomancy: Start Coding Now

A philosophical take on coding lessons. In a casual and intellectual setting, Adam and James unlock the mysterious hidden powers of the common web browser dev console - unlocking the gateway to the full power of code. We cover introductory Javascript, DOM manipulation, and networking, while reflecting on the secrets of the universe.

## Science Guys: Cleansing the Palette with PBS SPACETIME

#### Adam & James {number}

### PLANNING & TOPIC

Another science guy show, demonstrating how bad-4ss the remarkably handsome Matt O'Dowd is. This is how you talk about Simultation Hypothesis, science guys! 

### PRODUCTION

- âœ… Develop an outline like this before the show starts, and start with cues and notes.
- ðŸš« Make a login for James, and create "unlinked" url `/unthinkme_planning``, 
- ðŸš« add md to database
- âœ…âœ… Is it smart to serve markdown from firestore?
- ðŸš« create hosted function `setMdToPlanningDb` (replace data), collection `planning`. 
- âœ… Add info from "theonesheet" here.
- ðŸš« Ask GPT if this deployment method is recommended, or something simpler.

### SHOW

- Thinking if I brand the podcast more, I won't need to edit so much - "it's just the pc".
- Remember that you are not perfectionist when the switch is up.
- Establish the context more at the top of the show, particularly how it relates to past videos and integral (might need notes). 
- I need to work on responding to James and asking questions and following his line. 
- I need to not swear towards the intro and conclusion of the video. Youtube punishes swearing, but audiences like it.

### ASSETS

- Need Categories of episode brands (by popularity probably):

    1 Documentary Style  
    2 Lectures  
    3 Adam & James  
    4 Group/Guest   
    5 Practices  
    6 One-Offs

- unThinkme stock assets for thumbnails, including titles, brand logos (per category and for show), integral model, 

- Consistent thubnails are probably good for brand, so lock a few parameters in.
